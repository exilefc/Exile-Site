<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>No Image/Text Macros in the FC chat.</strong> An exception to this is when someone requests a primal or raid macro.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be Kind and Courteous to other FC members.</strong> Arguing in a public space can make others feel uneasy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Drama in the FC chat.</strong> You can ask Council for help with issues with other members (provide screenshots). However you should try to solve the issue yourself first in a sensible way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Help out when/where you can!</strong> Exile has a wide range of members from new players to hardcore endgame raiders so try to answer their questions. Also, don’t be afraid to ask questions, we’re in it together!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inactivity without warning for more than 90 days will have your character pruned from the member list.</strong> Please let us know if you will be going inactive for a time - you will be moved to the distant friends list preserving your member rank and place in Exile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mind what you say.</strong> Our members come from many different countries and cultures, especially where English mightn’t be a first language. Take care to not offend others. For instance some words used in common Australian vernacular might be heavily offensive to those from other cultures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No chat spam.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No story spoilers.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Let us know if you have an alt character in the FC.</strong> There is a special ranking for alts which helps with member ranking/advancement. Failure to notify the council will lead to any alts being removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No shortened links unless OK’d by most members.</strong> We use them as well, but we don’t wish members to be exposed to malicious websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leaving the FC.</strong> If you exit the FC your original rank will not be restored without a valid reason for leaving (see (5)).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No ERP in the chat!</strong> Keep the FC chat clean.
For other kinds of minor roleplaying:  it’s allowed but please don’t expect other members to participate.</p>
<p>-these are our rules!</p>

</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="rank-structure">Rank Structure</h2>
<h3 id="fledging">FLEDGING</h3>
<p>The starter rank. All new members that join the FC will be a part of this rank and after about 2 weeks of being in the FC will be promoted to the next rank.</p>
<h3 id="sentinel">SENTINEL</h3>
<p>The standard rank. This rank will allow you to use the FC garden and fully access the first tab of the FC chest (and store in the 2nd and 3rd tabs). Sentinels can also use the house orchestion.</p>
<h3 id="warden">WARDEN</h3>
<p>This rank is given to members who have shown themselves to be outgoing and helpful to fellow FC members. Warden have the same priveleges as Sentinel with added features such as being able to recruit FC members and accepting applications of people applying to the FC. Wardens can also buy and execute FC buffs when needed.</p>
<h3 id="council">COUNCIL</h3>
<p>This rank is given to Wardens who have further proved themselves and are willing to help the FC as a whole and not just for their personal gain of being a higher rank. The Council has a seperate linkshell where they can discuss FC matters with other council members easily and immediately and privately. Council members have access to all tabs of the FC chest and can withdraw crystals from the FC chest. Council members have access to the housing tab of the FC house which allows them to decorate the FC house. More details on the Council below.</p>
<h3 id="second-in-command-sic">SECOND IN COMMAND (SIC)</h3>
<p>are council members that have even further proved themselves and strive themselves to care and look after the FC. They are essentially  the key advisors to the FC leader There are two SiCs so that the Exile Leader has two distinct perspectives to confer with. At this rank the SICs can promote and demote members of the FC. They also have permissions to remove members, but must confer with the rest of the council.</p>
<h3 id="mist-leader">MIST LEADER</h3>
<p>To become the leader of Exile is a similar matter to becoming council or SiC. However, those who are leader must demonstrate exceptional skills in leadership and have earned the right to take control over the FC. The Exile Leader is the only member that can withdraw gil from the chest. </p>
